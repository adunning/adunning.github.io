'Latin and Greek in Scientific Terminology' (CLA 201) is a highly popular course at the University of Toronto, and in teaching it this year I have aimed to include more material on the history of science and integrate current articles from scientists on the problems of developing and using nomenclature. After leading an intensive version of the course over the summer, I now have the opportunity to work with students again at a more relaxed pace this fall, and have posted a [course website](http://andrewdunning.ca/latin-greek-scientific-terminology/) that includes my syllabus, lecture slides, and a full bibliography. The [source files are available for download](https://github.com/adunning/latin-greek-scientific-terminology) for anyone who wishes to improve further on the material. The syllabus format is inspired by Lincoln Mullen's [Programming in History/New Media](http://lincolnmullen.com/courses/clio3.2014/) (building on the default [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) template).

*Update:* I have written [Greek and Latin for Scientists](http://www.dh.uni-leipzig.de/wo/workshop-december-2014/greek-and-latin-in-an-age-of-open-data-schedule/andrew-dunning-greek-and-latin-for-scientists/) reflecting on this class.
