Since the 1980s, Macintosh computers have shipped with a keyboard layout that makes it relatively easy to type diacritics and other symbols through the use of the Option key. This functionality has never been available on Windows, making it extremely cumbersome to type in foreign languages. I have created [two keyboard layouts](http://adunning.github.io/Mac-Keyboard-Layouts-for-Windows/) to fix this situation.

OS X itself does not use the US Extended keyboard layout by default, but for anything beyond the demands of Western European languages, it saves a huge amount of time.
