My [review of Jeffrey Witt's excellent work on *Sentences* commentaries](http://ride.i-d-e.de/issues/issue-3/petrus_plaoul/) is now out in *RIDE* 3. The model set forward here is the closest we have come yet to a sustainable model for publishing technology-independent critical editions that provide readers with the same evidence available to editors.
