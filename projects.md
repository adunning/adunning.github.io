## Online Sources for Medieval History

Historical sources becomes far more accessible when they can be easily discovered online in a readable and accurate format. There are now many public-domain texts that have been made available through resources such as [Archive.org](https://archive.org). By editing these for repositories such as [Project Gutenberg](http://gutenberg.org) and [Wikisource](https://wikisource.org), we can make these available in a corrected format that facilitates online reading or printing, and allows the text to be reused for research purposes. I frequently make electronic editions of public-domain books to support my teaching. I archive corrected versions of these online wherever possible, focusing on quality rather than quantity.

This also provides the opportunity for thinking about the possibilities for reading in a digital format, and what needs to be recorded to present historical texts online in a professional manner. While for critical editions I normally use the XML-based guidelines of the [Text Encoding Initiative](http://tei-c.org), Project Gutenberg is focused around [reStructuredText](http://epubmaker.pglaf.org), which is much simpler but too limiting for many purposes. There is also serious potential for the use of [Wikisource](https://wikisource.org) among historians, since it provides the key ability to link a text to a facsimile.

I have made corrected electronic versions of the following texts:

- *Benedict's Rule for Monasteries*, trans. Leonard Doyle ([source on GitHub](https://github.com/adunning/benedict-rule-doyle)): This work is read in almost every class covering early medieval history, but often in a painfully archaic form. The online edition of Doyle's text is a stopgap measure: I am now working on a new translation of the text with notes.
- *Early Lives of Charlemagne by Eginhard and the Monk of St Gall*, trans. A.J. Grant ([Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/48870); [source on GitHub](https://github.com/adunning/early-lives-charlemagne)): Einhard's *Vita Karoli* is one of the most important sources for the Carolingians: Grant's translation is an immense improvement over that of Turner that was previously distributed online.
- Geoffrey Bache Smith, *A Spring Harvest*, ed. J.R.R. Tolkien ([Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/48371); [source on GitHub](https://github.com/adunning/spring-harvest)): A collection of poetry from the First World War, useful for studying the influence of medievalism in this period.
- John of Damascus, *On Holy Images* ([Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/49917)): Key for understanding the history of art.

Forthcoming (write me if you want to collaborate on any of these):

- G.G. Coulton, *Social Life in Britain from the Conquest to the Reformation* ([Archive.org](http://archive.org/details/sociallifeinbrit00couluoft))
- *The Didascalicon of Hugh of St. Victor: A Medieval Guide to the Arts*, trans. Jerome Taylor ([Archive.org](http://archive.org/details/didascaliconmedi00hugh))
- *Dodi ve-nechdi (Uncle and nephew)*, trans. Hermann Gollancz ([Archive.org](https://archive.org/details/cu31924012267781))
- Ernest F. Henderson, *Select Historical Documents of the Middle Ages* ([Archive.org](https://archive.org/details/selectdocuments00hend))
- *St. Anselm. Proslogium; Monologium; An Appendix in Behalf of the Fool by Gaunilon; and Cur Deus homo*, trans. Sidney Norton Deane ([Archive.org](https://archive.org/details/stanselmeproslog00anseuoft))

## [Mac Keyboard Layouts for Windows](http://andrewdunning.ca/Mac-Keyboard-Layouts-for-Windows/)

North American keyboards are resolutely xenophobic without the help of a keyboard layout that allows for the use of accented characters. The Mac keyboard has allowed this since the 1980s, and OS X added a US Extended layout that allows for an even greater range of languages, making it crucial for efficient academic work. These keyboard layouts replicate this behaviour for Windows.
