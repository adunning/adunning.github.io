## [Mac Keyboard Layouts for Windows](http://andrewdunning.ca/Mac-Keyboard-Layouts-for-Windows/)

North American keyboards are resolutely xenophobic without the help of a keyboard layout that allows for the use of accented characters. The Mac keyboard has allowed this since the 1980s, and OS X added a US Extended layout that allows for an even greater range of languages, making it crucial for efficient academic work. These keyboard layouts replicate this behaviour for Windows.

## [Geoffrey Bache Smith, *A Spring Harvest*](http://andrewdunning.ca/spring-harvest/)

J.R.R. Tolkien edited a volume of the poetry of his friend G.B. Smith (18 October 1894â€“3 December 1916), who died in the First World War; it is difficult to obtain, and unjustly obscure. This is the first digital text of the book, which I have also made available as an [e-book through Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/48371). The [source files are on GitHub](https://github.com/adunning/spring-harvest).
