## [Latin and Greek in Scientific Terminology](http://andrewdunning.ca/latin-greek-scientific-terminology/)

### University of Toronto: Summer 2014, Fall 2014

The natural sciences, and the life sciences in particular, employ an enormous vocabulary of technical terms, presenting a sizeable challenge to the beginning student. The complexity of these terms is owed in part to the fact that many were formed from Greek and Latin words, in order to allow for easier communication within a multilingual scientific community at a time when most of its members learned these languages as a core part of their education. Although most students of the sciences are no longer expected to learn classical languages, a basic exposure to the Latin and Greek elements of scientific language can make it much easier to understand the meaning of technical terms and to expand oneâ€™s scientific vocabulary.
