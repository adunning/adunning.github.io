## [Latin and Greek in Scientific Terminology](http://andrewdunning.ca/latin-greek-scientific-terminology/)

### University of Toronto: Summer 2014, Fall 2014

The natural sciences, and the life sciences in particular, employ an enormous vocabulary of technical terms, presenting a sizeable challenge to the beginning student. The complexity of these terms is owed in part to the fact that many were formed from Greek and Latin words, to allow for easier communication within a multilingual scientific community at a time when most of its members learned these languages as a core part of their education. This course provides a basic exposure to the Latin and Greek elements of scientific language to facilitate understanding of technical vocabulary and enable students to use appropriate language in communicating with both specialists and the general public. It also provides an overview of the history of scientific communication to allow students to both appreciate and improve upon contemporary methodology for the dissemination or research.
