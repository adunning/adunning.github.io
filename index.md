I make books from the distant past accessible to everyone. I teach at the [University of Toronto](https://utoronto.ca), and was previously a curator of medieval manuscripts at the [British Library](https://bl.uk). This website is a collection of pre-publication versions of my academic writing and other notes. [See ORCID for a list of my published research](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0464-5036).
