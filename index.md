I am a PhD candidate at the University of Toronto's [Centre for Medieval Studies](http://medieval.utoronto.ca), specializing in interactions between schools and monasticism in twelfth- and thirteenth-century England and France, as well as developing digital techniques for working with medieval manuscripts. This site incorporates links to the [courses I teach](/teaching/) and my [research](/research).
